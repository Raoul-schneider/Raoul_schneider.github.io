            <h1>Astronomy</h1>
            <p>I have been interested in astronomy and I am Member of the Société Astronomique de Bourgogne (SAB) since 2018<br>
                What I love in astronomy : above all being under a beautiful clear sky, looking for an astronomical object (galaxy, nebula, star cluster...),
                seeing a rare event (supernova, eclipse, meteor, the passage of a comet...). It's amazing to realize how far and big can be a small thing in a telescope.</p>
            <p>
                <br><br>I took part in the conference <em>Les particules élémentaires</em> with the teenager group of the SAB, online since june 2021 on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sRtHZ2luVQ" target="_blank">youtube</a><br>
                My telescope : Dobson Orion 254/1200.<br>My filters : OIII, UHC, polarizing filter for the moon<br>
                My Eyepieces : plössl Sirius 25mm 55°?, ABBE Takahashi 6mm ?°, SWA Baader 10mm  68°<br>
                The softwares I use : Stellarium but also Gimp and Siril for astrophotography

            <h1>Musique</h1>
            <p>As far back as I can remember, I have always loved music,<br>whether it’s listening to records or going to concerts, operas or other shows.<br>
                I've been playing the violin since the age of 7. At the age of 10, I then took up the viola, 
                as I loved the fullness and pitch of the sound, which is deeper than that of the violin.<br>
                I play in small ensembles at my music school (Orgeux) and, since 2022, I've been taking part in week-long string orchestral 
                courses with a big final concert (Chevigny-Saint-Sauveur).<br>
                When I play in a string orchestra, I personally prefer the viola. They are right in the middle making them the very ‘hub’ of the orchestra. The viola parts are very interesting as they often accompany other instruments and are thus in constant dialogue.

                Playing music is a source of relaxation, pleasure and motivation.  Sometimes it's a challenge of perseverance, and it always demands hard work and consistency. There are moments in orchestral music that are so powerful that they are widely worth the work we put into them.</p>

            <p>For the last five years I've been a volunteer with the Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux (League for the Protection of Birds), working as a ringing assistant for one or two weeks a year at the ringing camp at the Lac de Marcenay in Burgundy. The aim is to ring passerines in order to study post-nuptial migration and the importance of reed beds as migratory stopovers.</p>
