            <h1>My home education</h1>
            <p><strong>I've never been to school !</strong> 
                Yes, by choice and just like all my siblings, I've always been educated at home. The project-based, 
                interest-led approach used in my family allowed me to focus on my passions at every age and learn dynamically 
                and at my own pace, manipulating, giving presentations, experimenting, putting what I have learnt into practice 
                and in the real world. Learning by immersion in real life, in a way! Note that despite being outside the 
                mainstream, my education at home has been validated every year through visits from the Education Nationale inspectors.

                The expressions ‘Homeschooling’ or  ‘home education’ do not of course mean being educated exclusively by one’s parents. 
                I have also learnt from others: leaders and members of associations, authors, people from the cultural and scientific 
                worlds, friends, adults and children... ! And it is not just at home - I have also learnt many other places: in the wild, 
                museums, exhibitions, conferences, trips, workshops, extra-curricular activities, associations, internships, and so on. I'm 
                used to working on interdisciplinary projects, which has given me the opportunity to deepen my interests and acquire autonomy 
                in my work, as well as to carry out group projects. As a self-motivated person, I enjoy learning and putting 
                into practice what I have learnt.</p>

            <h2>Baccalaureate STI2D</h2>
            <p>
                I decided to take the STI2D technological baccalaureate so that I could study computer science.
                Yes, you can prepare for the bac without going to lycée and even without remote learning!<br>
                Of course, you need to be well-informed about the syllabus and exams, well-equipped with textbooks<br>
                and well-organized, independent and above all motivated !
            </p>
            <h3>What's it like to take the bac as an independent candidate?</h3>
            <p>
                I take all the final exams like<br>a high school student, but as I don't have any continuous assessment marks,<br>
                I have to take a series of extra exams (no less than ten indeed!) for all the other subjects between May and June.</p>
